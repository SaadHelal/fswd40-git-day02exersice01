		<h1>Basic Exercise | Create an HTML page</h1>
			<p>Create your first HTML page using all necessary HTML elements. Within it, define at least 5 paragraphs and 5 headings. Test the result in your browser. </p>	
		<h2>Basic Exercise | HTML validation</h2>
			<p>Create your own HTML example and deliberately insert some errors. Then go to the W3C validator and try validation by file upload and by direct input. Did you get the expected errors?</p>
		<h3>Basic Exercise | Debugging</h3>
			<p>Try to fix the mistakes in this example (do not use validator but try to find typos by yourself!). When you fix the mistakes you find, also add new, different text formatting elements to the page which donâ€™t exist yet in this example.</p>
		<h4>Basic Exercise | Divs and Spans</h4>
			<p>Create an HTML document, containing the lyrics to a song you like. Now define a few divs and spans and use them to structure the content of the lyrics in a useful way.</p>
		<h5>Basic Exercise | Page structure</h5>
			<p>Now create a new HTML document using paragraphs, headings and text formatting elements to create a web page for your favorite movie. Whether it's from an actual movie or not is up to you, but try to use these elements appropriately to give the text appropriate significance.</p>
